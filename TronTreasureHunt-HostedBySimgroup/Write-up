Brute force the unknown characters
On June 16th, the latest clue released was #15 with the characters 1d.

The missing clues at this stage were 8, 42, 45, the character(s) for 11, 21 and 32 that had identical solutions and the character for 36 that was single digit.

There were 3 remaining clues but only 2 missing characters for the private key to the tron wallet. We realized rather quickly that one of the clues was a decoy.

Since the search space was now rather small, it was possible to code this straight in python rather than use another faster programming language.

The python code used can be found in my Github at the following link:
Mapl3sn0w’s Github

Private Key
The final private key for the tron wallet was the following: 5d88cb69c5ded08d0f4d1d5551fe5625d2c0118639ec7ae0048e4a53f5e2c59f

Tronscan.org allows for a quick wallet import using a private key.

I quickly logged into the wallet and transferred out the contents to my addy.

Final Words
Again a big thanks to all those who made this treasure hunt possible and to Arpox for the collaboration.

Looking forward to the next one !

Cheers.
